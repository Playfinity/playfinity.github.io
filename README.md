## Welcome to Playfinity

Playfinity is about active gaming.

We have created a **game console** (a small puck loaded with sensors). This game console can be used inside a ball, can be worn on your body, or used to whatever idea you have.

The console runs Playfinity playOS, and the SDKs on iOS and Android integrates with playOS.


## API

The best part is that we have made an API, so that you can get access to all our work, getting game events delivered to your app:

- ball throw
- ball catch
- ball bounce
- ball miss
- ball flight air-time
- ball height
- ball speed
- jump
- land on feet. We shall add land on back and land on front.
- events have attached properties such as
  - jump height
  - jump rotation in degrees
- ball kick
- ball bounce
- ball miss
- ball flight air-time
- ball height
- top button
- top button release
- side button
- side button release

If you do not yet have the console or the ball, you can buy it from our shop: https://playfinity.io

We have made the API for:

- [Android](https://github.com/Playfinity/playfinity-recorder-android)
- [iOS](https://github.com/Playfinity/playfinity-starter-ios)
